**Prompt:**
“How to space out nav items evenly across the header?”

**AI Response Summary:**
Use `display: flex` with `gap`, and for full spacing between ends, wrap nav and logo inside a flex container with `justify-content: space-between`.

**Reflection:**
Great trick. Helped align logo and links properly and adapt well on different screens.
