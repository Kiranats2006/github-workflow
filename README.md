##  4. Anticipated Challenges and Strategies

### Challenges:
- Merge conflicts while syncing code
- Delays due to pending UI decisions
- Ineffective Copilot prompts leading to bad suggestions

### Strategies:
- Use Git branches per feature â†’ merge only after peer review  
- Assign UI deadlines early to prevent coding delays  
- Prepare Copilot prompts as a team before using
